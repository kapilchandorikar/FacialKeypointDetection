        ## TODO: Define all the layers of this CNN, the only requirements are:
        ## 1. This network takes in a square (same width and height), grayscale image as input
        ## 2. It ends with a linear layer that represents the keypoints
        ## it's suggested that you make this last layer output 136 values, 2 for each of the 68 keypoint (x, y) pairs
