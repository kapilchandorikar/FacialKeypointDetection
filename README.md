# Facial Keypoint Detection
A facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The completed code is be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.

## Project notebooks
The project will be broken up into a few main parts:

+ [Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data](https://github.com/kapilchandorikar/FacialKeypointDetection/blob/master/1.%20Load%20and%20Visualize%20Data.ipynb)   
+ [Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints](https://github.com/kapilchandorikar/FacialKeypointDetection/blob/master/2.%20Define%20the%20Network%20Architecture.ipynb)
