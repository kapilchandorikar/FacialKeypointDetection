    "After you've looked at the data you're working with and, in this case, know the shapes of the images and of the keypoints, you are ready to define a convolutional neural network that can *learn* from this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and in `models.py`, you will:\n",
    "1. Define a CNN with images as input and keypoints as output\n",
    "2. Construct the transformed FaceKeypointsDataset, just as before\n",
    "3. Train the CNN on the training data, tracking loss\n",
    "4. See how the trained model performs on test data\n",
    "5. If necessary, modify the CNN structure and model hyperparameters, so that it performs *well* **\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\*** What does *well* mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well\" means that the model's loss decreases during training **and**, when applied to test image data, the model produces keypoints that closely match the true keypoints of each face. And you'll see examples of this later in the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "To define a neural network in PyTorch, you define the layers of a model in the function `__init__` and define the feedforward behavior of a network that employs those initialized layers in the function `forward`, which takes in an input image tensor, `x`. The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n",

    "As a reminder, a conv/pool layer may be defined like this (in `__init__`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1 input image channel (for grayscale images), 32 output channels/feature maps, 3x3 square convolution kernel\n",
    "self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# maxpool that uses a square window of kernel_size=2, stride=2\n",
    "self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refer to Layers in `forward`\n",
    "Then referred to in the `forward` function like this, in which the conv1 layer has a ReLu activation applied to it before maxpooling is applied:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to place any layers whose weights will change during the training process in `__init__` and refer to them in the `forward` function; any layers or functions that always behave in the same way, such as a pre-defined activation function, should appear *only* in the `forward` function."
